This repository contains JavaScript practice on User-Defined Functions (Class 19). It demonstrates how to create, call, and use custom functions for performing different operations such as greetings, addition, and checking even/odd numbers.
# 🚀 JavaScript User-Defined Functions (Class 19)

This project covers **User-Defined Functions in JavaScript**, showcasing how to create and use custom functions to perform specific tasks. Functions make code reusable, organized, and easier to understand.  

## 📌 Concepts Covered
✅ **Basic Function** – `sayHello()` prints a greeting message.  
✅ **Parameterized Function** – `greet(name)` prints a personalized message.  
✅ **Return Function** – `add(a, b)` returns the sum of two numbers.  
✅ **Function without Parameters** – `addition()` adds two fixed numbers.  
✅ **Even/Odd Checker** – `isEven(num)` checks whether a number is even or odd.  

## 🧩 Why This is Important
Functions are the building blocks of any programming language. They help in:
- Code **reusability**
- Better **organization**
- Easier **debugging**
- Improved **logic building**

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `.html` file in your browser.  
3. Open **Console (F12)** to see the output.
